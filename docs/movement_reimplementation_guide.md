# Movement System Reimplementation Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the reimplementation of the movement system in GemBrawl from a mixed 2D/3D approach to a proper 3D implementation for correct 2.5D isometric gameplay.

## Problems with Previous Implementation

1. **Mixed 2D/3D Approach**: Used `CharacterBody2D` with complex coordinate transformations
2. **Inconsistent Coordinate Systems**: Arena and player used different conversion methods
3. **Camera Simulation Issues**: `Camera2D` couldn't properly simulate 3D perspective

## New 3D Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. HexGrid3D Utility Class (`scripts/hex_grid_3d.gd`)
- Provides consistent hex-to-3D coordinate conversion
- Uses pointy-top hexagon orientation
- Single source of truth for all position calculations
- Key methods:
  - `hex_to_world_3d()`: Convert hex coords to 3D position
  - `world_to_hex_3d()`: Convert 3D position to hex coords
  - `get_hexes_in_radius()`: Get all hexes within radius
  - `hex_distance()`: Calculate distance between hexes

#### 2. HexArena3D (`scripts/hex_arena_3d.gd`)
- Generates arena using `MeshInstance3D` nodes
- Creates procedural hex meshes
- Manages floor tiles, hazards, and spawn points
- All elements exist in the same 3D coordinate space

#### 3. Player3D (`scripts/player_3d.gd`)
- Uses `CharacterBody3D` for proper 3D physics
- Two movement modes:
  - **Free Movement**: Smooth analog movement
  - **Hex-Snapped**: Discrete hex-to-hex movement
- Automatic hex position tracking
- Proper rotation and facing direction

#### 4. CameraController3D (`scripts/camera_controller_3d.gd`)
- Pivot-based camera system
- Adjustable tilt angle (15° - 75°)
- Zoom, pan, and rotation controls
- Follow target with smoothing
- Edge panning support

### Scene Structure

├── CameraController
│   └── CameraPivot
│       └── Camera3D

### Key Improvements

1. **Unified Coordinate System**: All objects use the same 3D space
2. **Proper Camera Perspective**: Real 3D camera with adjustable tilt
3. **Consistent Movement**: Player and arena perfectly aligned
4. **Better Visual Quality**: Proper lighting and shadows
5. **Flexible Movement Options**: Support for both free and grid-based movement

### Usage

1. **Running the New System**:
   - The main scene is now `hex_arena_3d_gameplay.tscn`
   - All 3D components work together seamlessly

2. **Camera Controls**:
   - Page Up/Down: Adjust tilt angle
   - Mouse Wheel: Zoom in/out
   - Middle Mouse: Pan camera
   - Q/E: Rotate camera (optional)

3. **Player Movement**:
   - WASD/Arrows: Move player
   - Supports gamepad input
   - Toggle between free/hex-snapped movement via export variable

### Migration Notes

- Old 2D scenes are preserved but no longer used
- Gem data and resources work with both systems
- Skills will need updating to use 3D positions
- UI elements remain as 2D overlay

### Future Enhancements

1. Add navigation mesh for AI pathfinding
2. Implement hex-based line of sight
3. Add height variation to hexes
4. Create visual effects for hazards
5. Implement multiplayer synchronization

## Conclusion

The new 3D implementation provides a solid foundation for 2.5D hexagonal gameplay with proper isometric view and camera control. The system is more maintainable, visually accurate, and easier to extend.
