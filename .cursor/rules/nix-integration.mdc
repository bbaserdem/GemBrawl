# NixOS Development Workflow

### **ðŸ”„ Environment Management**

After the dev shell is updated, use `direnv` reload command to apply changes.
```bash
# âœ… Enter development shell (automatically via direnv)
# Just cd into the project - direnv handles the rest

# âœ… Rebuild environment after adding packages
nix develop

# âœ… Check environment status
nix flake show
```

### **Adding New Dependencies**

When new dependencies are required in the environment;
- Never edit `flake.nix`
- Suggest changes to `flake.nix` without updating it.
- If there is a new dependency needed, always mention how viable it is to use in NixOS.
