# Combat Collision Detection Implementation Summary

## Task 5.3 Status: 95% Complete âœ…

### Implemented Components

#### 1. **Collision Layer System** (`combat_layers.gd`)
- 8 defined layers: World, Player, Player Hitbox, Enemy, Enemy Hitbox, Projectile, Pickup, Hazard
- Proper collision masks configured for each layer type
- Helper functions: `setup_combat_body()` and `setup_combat_area()`
- Clear separation between what can hit what

#### 2. **Melee Combat System** (`melee_hitbox.gd`)
- Area3D-based hitboxes that activate for a limited time
- Single-hit prevention per target
- Knockback system with configurable force
- Hit pause effect for impact feel
- Automatic deactivation after specified duration

#### 3. **Projectile System** (`projectile.gd`)
- CharacterBody3D-based projectiles with physics movement
- Optional homing capability
- Pierce through multiple targets option
- Lifetime management with auto-destruction
- Gravity support for arcing projectiles
- Visual effects support (hit effects, trails)

#### 4. **AoE Attack System** (`aoe_attack.gd`)
- Multiple shape support:
  - Sphere: Radius-based damage
  - Cone: Directional cone attack
  - Line: Linear damage path
  - Ring: Donut-shaped damage area
- Single damage or damage-over-time modes
- Proper overlap detection using PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D
- Visual effects integration

#### 5. **Combat Manager** (`combat_manager.gd`)
- Singleton for global combat state management
- Hit registration and tracking
- Combo system with configurable window
- Friendly fire toggle
- Active projectile/AoE management
- Combat event signals

#### 6. **Damage System** (`damage_system.gd`)
- Multiple damage types: Physical, Magical, True, Elemental
- Critical hit system (10% base chance, 1.5x multiplier)
- Defense calculations based on damage type
- Elemental effectiveness (rock-paper-scissors style)
- Damage info structure for detailed damage tracking

#### 7. **Player Integration** (`player_3d.gd`)
- `take_damage_info()` method for receiving damage
- Proper collision layer setup
- Invulnerability frames after taking damage
- Visual damage feedback (damage numbers)
- Health change signals
- Defense calculation methods

#### 8. **Test Environment** (`test_combat_collision.tscn`)
- Comprehensive test scene with hex arena
- Multiple players for testing PvP
- Test controls for all attack types
- Debug UI for monitoring hits
- Camera controls for observation

### Key Features

1. **Collision Detection**:
   - Melee: Area3D nodes detect overlapping bodies
   - Projectile: CharacterBody3D collision with move_and_slide()
   - AoE: PhysicsDirectSpaceState3D shape queries

2. **Damage Flow**:
   - Attack creates DamageInfo object
   - DamageSystem calculates final damage
   - Target receives damage through take_damage_info()
   - Visual feedback spawned (damage numbers)
   - Combat events emitted

3. **Safety Features**:
   - Targets can only be hit once per attack
   - Proper null checks and validation
   - Invulnerability frames prevent damage spam
   - Collision layers prevent self-damage

### Minor Issues Fixed

1. **Forward Direction**: Corrected to use `-transform.basis.z` (Godot standard)
2. **Documentation**: Created `godot_direction_reference.gd` for team reference

### Testing Instructions

1. Run the test scene: `godot --scene res://scenes/test_combat_collision.tscn`
2. Controls:
   - **Enter/X Button**: Melee attack
   - **Q/Square**: Fire projectile
   - **E/Circle**: AoE attack
   - **Tab**: Switch controlled player
   - **WASD/Arrows**: Move player
   - **Space**: Jump

### Integration Ready

The collision detection system is fully functional and ready for:
- Skill system integration (Task 7)
- Visual effects enhancement
- Sound effect integration
- Network synchronization (for multiplayer)

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Add visual feedback for different attack types
2. Integrate sound effects for impacts
3. Create more varied attack patterns
4. Test with actual gem skills
