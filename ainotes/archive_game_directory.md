# Archiving the Old Game Directory

## Summary
The migration from `game/` to `gembrawl/` is complete. The old `game/` directory contains:
- Original prototype files (all migrated)
- Godot editor metadata (.godot folder)
- Empty folders: networking/, tilesets/
- Icon files (icon.png, icon.svg)
- Simple main.tscn with "Hello World"

## Recommendation
The `game/` directory can be safely removed or archived. All functional code has been migrated to `gembrawl/`.

## Archive Command
To create an archive before deletion:
```bash
tar -czf game_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz game/
```

## Removal Command
After confirming the archive:
```bash
rm -rf game/
```
