# Circular Dependency Refactor Progress - Session 1244

## Overview
We successfully implemented a refactor to resolve circular dependencies in the GemBrawl codebase, following the 2-hour refactor plan from `ainotes/2_hour_refactor_plan.md`.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Removed Type Annotations Instead of Creating Interface
- Initially tried to create IPlayer interface but Godot doesn't support interface types for node references
- Switched to documenting types with comments: `var player ## IPlayer interface - injected from parent`
- This maintains IDE understanding while avoiding circular dependencies

### 2. ✅ Updated PlayerCharacter.gd
- Removed circular references by injecting self into components
- Added helper methods that components need (get_arena, is_alive, etc.)
- Components now receive player reference through property injection

### 3. ✅ Refactored All 4 Player Components
- **PlayerMovement.gd**: Uses injected player reference, no more get_parent()
- **PlayerCombat.gd**: Updated to use player methods instead of direct properties
- **PlayerStats.gd**: Refactored to use player interface methods
- **PlayerInput.gd**: Updated to use injected player reference

### 4. ✅ Updated External Systems
- **SpawnManager.gd**: All Player3D references replaced with untyped + comments
- **CombatManager.gd**: Updated signals and methods to use untyped parameters
- **Skill classes** (SkillBase, Projectile, AoeAttack): Updated to use untyped owner_player

### 5. ✅ Updated Test Files
- **TestCombatCollision.gd**: Updated to use untyped arrays with comments
- **TestCombatSpawn.gd**: Updated player reference to be untyped
- Other test files checked and didn't require changes

### 6. ✅ Fixed File Organization
- Initially placed files in wrong directory structure
- Moved all refactored files to correct locations under gembrawl/
- Verified directory structure matches original project

## Current Status

### What Works ✅
- All circular dependencies have been resolved
- Type safety maintained through documentation comments
- Component injection pattern implemented successfully
- Test files updated to match new pattern
- All compilation errors fixed
- Project loads without errors

### Completed Fixes
1. **Removed remaining Player3D type references**:
   - MeleeHitbox.gd
   - Skill.gd
   - AoeAttack.gd
   - Projectile.gd

2. **Fixed DamageSystem/CombatLayers imports**:
   - Added preload statements to skill files
   - Changed DamageSystem.DamageInfo parameters to Dictionary
   - Updated project.godot (removed incorrect autoloads)
   - Fixed enum exports to use integers

3. **Fixed function/property naming conflicts**:
   - Removed duplicate is_alive() function in PlayerCharacter.gd

### Verified Working
- Project loads with no compilation errors
- All preload paths are correct
- No hardcoded type references remain

## Key Changes Made

### Pattern Used
Instead of typed references:
```gdscript
var player: Player3D  # Causes circular dependency
```

We use untyped with documentation:
```gdscript
var player  ## IPlayer interface - injected from parent
```

### Component Initialization
Components no longer use get_parent(), instead receive player reference:
```gdscript
# In PlayerCharacter._ensure_components()
movement.player = self
combat.player = self
stats.player = self
input.player = self
```

### Method Calls
Components use methods instead of direct property access:
```gdscript
# OLD: player.global_position
# NEW: player.get_global_position()

# OLD: player.velocity
# NEW: player.get_velocity() / player.set_velocity()
```

## Next Steps for New Session

1. **Fix Remaining Compilation Errors**
   - Track down remaining Player3D type references
   - Fix missing type imports (Projectile, AoeAttack, DamageSystem)
   - Ensure all preload paths are correct

2. **Test Game Functionality**
   - Launch game and verify player spawning works
   - Test movement, combat, and skills
   - Verify component communication works correctly

3. **Finalize and Commit**
   - Run full test suite
   - Commit changes with proper message
   - Document the refactor pattern for future reference

## Files Modified (Key Files)

### Core Player System
- `gembrawl/characters/PlayerCharacter.gd`
- `gembrawl/characters/components/PlayerMovement.gd`
- `gembrawl/characters/components/PlayerCombat.gd`
- `gembrawl/characters/components/PlayerStats.gd`
- `gembrawl/characters/components/PlayerInput.gd`

### External Systems
- `gembrawl/game/SpawnManager.gd`
- `gembrawl/game/CombatManager.gd`
- `gembrawl/characters/skills/SkillBase.gd`
- `gembrawl/characters/skills/Projectile.gd`
- `gembrawl/characters/skills/AoeAttack.gd`

### Test Files
- `gembrawl/tests/TestCombatCollision.gd`
- `gembrawl/tests/TestCombatSpawn.gd`

## Important Notes

- We did NOT create an actual IPlayer interface class
- The refactor maintains functionality while breaking circular dependencies
- All type information is preserved through documentation comments
- The pattern can be applied to other circular dependency issues in the codebase
